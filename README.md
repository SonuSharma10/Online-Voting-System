# ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 
## Problem Statement:
In the democratic republic of India, the traditional method of voting has been the cornerstone of the electoral process for decades. The problem at hand is to design and develop a secure, transparent, and efficient online voting system that complements the existing electoral process in India while addressing various challenges that arise from the digital domain. This online voting system should aim to enhance voter participation, minimize fraud, and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of votes cast.

## Functionalities:

#### •	Security and Privacy:
  It will have a robust and tamper-proof online voting system that guarantees the privacy of voters while ensuring the authenticity of their identities to prevent impersonation or multiple voting.
  
#### • Authentication and Verification: 
Implementation of foolproof methods for voter authentication to ensure that only eligible voters can cast their ballots and preventing unauthorized access.
  
#### •	Resilience to Cyberattacks: 
It will be a system that can withstand and repel various cyber threats, hacking attempts, and data breaches.

## Scope:

Biometrics of Adhaar card can be used to authorize and verify the handicap users especially who have problem with their hands or eyes.
 
## Aim:

•	The system will use Adhaar as the database and verify each user with their biometrics so the number of frauds will be reduced.
•	Ensuring that the proposed online voting system adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines set by the Election Commission of India and other authorities.
•	Ensuring that citizens are well-informed about the online voting process and its procedures to encourage wider participation and minimize confusion.
